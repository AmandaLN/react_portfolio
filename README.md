# React Portfolio
## Description
In this assignment I created a responsive portfolio website. I first had to create three HTML pages and link them together in the nav bar tag. Once that was completed I worked on the one page at a time. Creating the about me I started with rows and columns. I nested my linkdin profile to the icon. Getting am image from my google drive I added the link in the HTML then continued with the my bio. The portfolio page I did rows. Getting another image link for the card I wanted to use, I added that to it. For the contact page there are rows and columns. I had to add padding to the left side of the form so it would not be right on the end of the page. Adding icons with my information on the right side.
